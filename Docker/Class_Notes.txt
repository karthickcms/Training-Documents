	Containerization using Docker ::::
	
		Micro-Service based applications --> 
		
	Containerization :::
	
		- It is process of packaging the applications along with its' dependencies.
		
	Virtual Machine :::
	
		- It is called as Hardware Level Virtualization 
		- It is created using Hypervisor 
		- VMs are used to execute Operating System 
		- Even if there is no active task/application, VM will be up and running continuously
		- VMs consume more space and time to start-up
	
	Container :::
	
		- It is called as OS Level Virtualization 
		- It is created using Container Engine 
		- Containers are used to execute Applications/Task, NOT Operating System 
		- If there is no active task/application, Containers will immediately goes to EXIT State.
		- It consume less space and time to start the application.
		
		
	Infra-Structure Perspective :::

		Containers are used to reduce the no. of Virtual Machines.
